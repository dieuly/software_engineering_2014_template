### Chapter describing the functional and non-functional requirements

* Functional Requirements:
- 


* functional requirements (FR): a listing of details that are related to use cases
* FRs tells in detail what have to be considered when use cases are implemented in the system
  * Good functional requirements are traceable and verifiable: from the end product you can easily see does the FR in documentation exist in the software
  * Sommerville "These are statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs, and how the system should behave in particular situations. ..." (p. 85 in Sommerville: Software engineering 9)
* non-functional requirements: requirements describing the system in general
  * constraints related to system performance, reliability, security, accessibility, price, process model, etc.
