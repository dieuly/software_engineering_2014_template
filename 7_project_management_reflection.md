### Project management, self reflection, last chapter

* Sum up here your project
    We've created this project to make a location specific app that notifies useful information for teachers and students

* Was it successful, how was the communication
    It was quite successful. As for the communication, it was difficult to understand what each of us imagined of our app's UI design when we just explained it in words. It was easier when we made use of our drawings. 

* What you would do differently for the next project
    We would start the project earlier than we did this time. It was not productive to do things at the last minute because of stress.

* What were the easy parts in the project? What was hard?
    Imagining use cases was easy, but writing the system architecture part was difficult because it was hard to connect main components with sub-components and their workflow. Also, we stayed off topic at the initial stage of this documentation. But, thanks to suggestion from teacher, we could complete this documentation quite successfully.

* List here also estimation of hours spent in total and by each member in the project
    It took around 10 hours in practice for each person, including the time we spent imaginizing and analyzing during the lectures.
